Task 2: Merge vs Rebase

---

##### Subtask 1.1

I created new branch for merging then I created there a file. I put some text into file and made ```git add``` and ```git commit```. Then I switched to ```main``` created a file and switched back to previous branch and changed a file again and made ```git marge```.

##### Subtask 2.2

I created new branch for rebasing then I created there a file. I put some text into file and made ```git add``` and ```git commit```. Then I switched to ```main``` created a file and switched back to previous branch and changed a file again and returned to ```main``` for changing my file. Then I have made ```git rebase```

#### Conclusion

As we can see, when we are doing ```git merge``` in ```git log``` out commits posted by date. When we are doing ```git rebase``` firstly posted local commits and then remote.

#### Questions:

1. I liked it better command ```git merge```.
2. Merge is best to use in projects where the order of commits is important, and rebase where it is more important to track local commits.
